# Conway-s-Game
Python code that implements Conway's game
The Game of Life is based on a two dimensional grid in which cells can be either on or off. In this grid, one can make figures that evolve over time. At each point in time, the state of the next time point is computed. This results in the figures starting to move (they come to life). The next state of a cell depends on its current state, and the states of its direct neighbours. The rules are as follows: Assume that the cells are an m Ã— n matrix S, where m is the number of rows (vertical size of the grid) and n is the number of columns (horizontal size of the grid).  If S[i][j] is on, and it has 2 or 3 neighbours that are on, it will remain on in the next state.  If S[i][j] is off, and it has three neighbours that are on, it will be turned on in the next state.  In all other cases, S[i][j] will be off in the next state.
